 <b> <I style="family-font: aria-valuenow">NATURE IS THE BEST HEALER </I></b> </pre><p> Naturopathic medicine is a system that uses natural remedies to help the body heal itself. It embraces many therapies, including herbs, massage, acupuncture, exercise, and nutritional counseling. Naturopathy was brought to the United States from Germany in the 1800s, but some of its treatments are centuries old. Today, it combines traditional treatments with modern science.</p>
          <p>The goal of naturopathic medicine is to treat the whole person -- that means mind, body, and spirit. It also aims to heal the root causes of an illness -- not just stop the symptoms.

                A naturopathic doctor may spend 1 to 2 hours examining you. He’ll ask questions about your health history, stress levels, and lifestyle habits. He may order lab tests.</p>      
       <h4> <b>Surrender to Yoga</b> </h4>
                <p>In the last 30 years, a flurry of research has surfaced about the positive effects of yoga on depression and anxiety. A recent study from the Duke University Medical Center suggests that having a regular yoga practice can be as effective as an antidepressant for relieving mild depression. How? Regular practice of yoga raises GABA levels, which you need if you want to feel peachy.

                But... yoga reminds me of my painful childhood. I have gone to great lengths to let go of the image of my mom in her '70s yoga gear, eyes closed, chanting "om" with a bunch of hippies. That time of our lives was difficult; she was trying to get over her heartbreak after my dad left and took his new bride to Paris. However, we have to redefine these kinds of associations as adults. "A grown-up is supposed to possess himself, to be his own person, to make decisions according to his wishes and his best judgment," wrote Howard Halpern in Cutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents. When it comes to yoga, I need to do that.
                
                But... I can't sit still. Doing yoga shouldn't feel like taking a standardized test, but the thought of spending an hour or more sitting still gave me GRE-test-taking flashbacks. The purpose of yoga is to slow your body and mind to a contemplative stillness. In her book When Things Fall Apart, Buddhist author Pema Chödrön says this of stillness: "Relax as it is. Once we know this instruction, we can put it into practice." Translation: In time, I'll stop counting the cracks on the wall and be still myself.</p>
